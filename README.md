## Ever wandered how long does it take to do a job?
**TimbramiTutto** enables everyone to simply keep track of how much time you spend on a task.

## Ever wondered how much time you spend on a job last year?
This apps saves automatically every session to create a **simple** and **searchable** history of work logs.

## Why
I wanted to experiment with **Kotlin** and generally get better in writing Android applications. Moreover, this is a simple app which
serves a real purpose and a friend mine uses it daily at his job.
